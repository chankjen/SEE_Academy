## Features

- Supports decimal numbers (floats)
- Performs the four basic arithmetic operations:
  - Addition ➕
  - Subtraction ➖
  - Multiplication ✖️
  - Division ➗

## How to Use

1. Run the Python script.
2. When prompted, enter the **first number** (decimals allowed).
3. Enter the **second number**.
4. The program will output:
   - The sum of the two numbers

## Example

```
Enter the first number: 10
Enter the second number: 3

Results of your two numbers:
